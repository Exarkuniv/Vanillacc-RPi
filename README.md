Vanilla Command and Conquer

This gets a Dos version of Command and Conquer running on the Pi4
This is not for beginners. you need the Copy of the game disks to pull all the correct files off for both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert 

See the Wiki here for the games to see what files you need. 
im including one file that was a big pain in the ass to find and extract. 
For the rest you are on your own.
